# dispak.sh
dispak.sh or DistroPak is a website for finding all packages and installing them to your linux computer using a .sh script.

It supports all distros and flavours as all scripts are installed using a .sh file and includes all package managers. 

## Installation

To install the packages, head over to the website dispak.sh and cherry pick your packages for installation, then checkout the items and install. It is almost like 3, 2, 1. 

## How does it work?

It works by grabbing the data from all the package managers (deb, dnf, pacman, flatpak etc) and putting them into their own shop, which would be dispak.sh. 

### TODO

* Make the website
    
    * Make it look modern and stuff

* Get some people to help out with the project

* Add some data to the website
